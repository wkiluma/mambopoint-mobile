# mambopoint Mobile Application

mambopoint Mobile Application
This is an application meant to help people connect to the different services they would want in the course of advancing their lives. In principal, mambopoint is meant to connect service providers and service seakers in one place. mambopoint is implemented in phases, with the first three being the most crucial. 

Phase I...

Phase I include the establishment of the platform which, in the eye of users, will be a normal application. This initial phase shall include the development of meeting points for the service providers and service seekers for the following services;
1. Career issues - jobs, consultancies and internships.
2. Accomodations - houses for rent, appartments and others.
3. Tenders creation and notifications.

The application is meant to provide an interface to register these services (career, accommodation, tenders, etc) and alert the subscribers for each new entry so they may take the necessary actions.

Phase II...

In this phase, mambopoint is envisioned to be a robust platform on which different services shall be connected through comprehensive API. It shall serve as a point where every service (mambo) meets the seeker, and hence the term "mambopoint". The platform features of mambopoint start manifesting in this phase and different services shall now be accomodated. Subscribers are meant to dynamically set their preferences for which to receive notifications. This feature is meant to make sure that our subscribers' inboxes are not flooded with emails from mambopoint.

Phase III...

This is a phase meant to reduce the burden of installing services in mobile platforms. mambopoint shall make it possible to connect to new services ...
