mambopoint Mobile Application
This is an application meant to help people connect to the different services they would want in the course of advancing their lives. Such services include career issues - jobs, consultancies and internships. It also include accomodations - houses for rent, appartments and others. 
The application is meant to provide an interface to register these services (career, accommodation, tenders, etc) and alert the subscribers for each new entry so they may take the necessary actions.
