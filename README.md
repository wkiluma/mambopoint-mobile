mambopoint Mobile Application
This is an application meant to help people connect to the different services they would want in the course of advancing their lives. Such services include 
1)	Career issues - jobs, consultancies and internships. 
2)  Accomodations - houses for rent, appartments and others. 
3)  Tenders creation and notifications
The application is meant to provide an interface to register these services (career, accommodation, tenders, etc) and alert the subscribers for each new entry so they may take the necessary actions. 
Basically, it mambopoint is a platform on which several services are running. These three are what we are starting with, with hopes to add more and more services. 
subscribers are meant to dynamically set their preferences for which to receive notifications. This feature is meant to make sure that our subscribers' inboxes are not flooded with emails from mambopoint.
